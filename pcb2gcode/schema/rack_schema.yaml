            drill: 0.7 # Read 0.7mm. Units can be specified from mm, in, mil and thou
          - drill: 0.8mm # The slot number is auto-incrementating. Here, it is 2
          - router: 1/16in # Use drill or router
          - slot: 4
            use: false # Slot 4 should not be used
          - use: false # Nor 5
          - drill: 0.4 # Meaning 0.4mm in slot 6
