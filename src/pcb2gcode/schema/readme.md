The schema directory serves 2 purposes:
 1. It create the schema to validate the various configuration files
 2. It specifies the default values which, in turn, can be used to create a default file

Therefore it is important to properly document all the nodes, as the documentation
will allow generating the comments of the generated files.

All schema files must end with **_schema.yaml**.
