List machining operations for a PCB.

    - PTH stands for Platted Through Hole.
        * To create platted through PCBs, a bare board is drilled first.
        The holes are then electro-chemically platted:
        - activation
        - electroless platting
        - eletro-platting
    - NPTH is for non-platted holes
        * Once a board has been platted, it is etched
        - Solder resist mask
        - Tenting or tining
        - Etch
        - Stripping
        * Then, the non-platted holes must be drilled
    - OUTLINE for routing the outline
        * This is the last operation since the board reaches it's final size
        * Tabs can be added, so the larger board can be used for:
        - applying solder paste
        - testing the board

    - ALL is typically for single sided board which are etched and don't need PTH
        * Most holes are still identified as PTH but are drilled along with NPTH
        * Final routing is applied too

    - FIRST is the same of PTH

    - FINAL is to do the final drills and route the contour.
